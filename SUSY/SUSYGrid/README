SUSYGrid README - 
Last update: 2013-05-12, Martin Tripiana (tripiana@cern.ch)


** Welcome!

The SUSYGrid package provides a series of scripts and hacks to create and analyze the .slha files for SUSY spectra, 
through the SUSYHIT (http://www.itp.kit.edu/~maggie/SUSY-HIT/) interface package.

It is customized at the moment to run in the context of GGM models, but can be easily adapted to fit other SUSY
scenarios. 



Installation
--------------------
just run the setup.sh script provided. It installs and compiles SUSYHIT and SuSpect packages, and sets the proper 
directory structure.

Then, you have to source the 'env.sh' script everytime you come back.

How to run
--------------------

  1. LOCAL
  -----------
To run your jobs type: 

  . RunDir/runSUSYGrid.sh

and check the available options. 


  2. LXPLUS BATCH
  -----------

For large grid runs, a more practical to run it is by making profit of the bath system on lxplus.
(check some details here http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki/bin/view/HEPProjects/BatchJobsOnLxplus) 

To submit your jobs just call : 

  . RunDir/subjobs_SUSYGrid.sh

and check the available options. 


Run MODES
----------
There are three running modes at the moment.
   
- 0 : custom mode                 Run over custom & discrete arrays (M1,mu,M3,Msq). It is configurable in python/SUSYHIT_SinglePhotonGrid_makeconfigfile.py
- 1 : scan mode                   Run a scan over (mu,M1) sub-space. It is configurable in python/SUSYHIT_SinglePhotonGrid_makeconfigfile_scan.py
                                  Check alternatives for mu<-->M1 relation (fraction, mu-fixed, mu-positive, É)
- 2 : grave mass scan mode        Run scan for gravitino mass, for a given discrete grid arrangement. It is configurable in python/SUSYHIT_SinglePhotonGrid_makeconfigfile_mGravScan.py

Output
----------

The output you get is a tarsal file with all the .slha files (*out) and a summary file where all the relevant parameters 
of the grid have been extracted (summary/SUSYGrid_out_pars.dat).
By default is located in: 

   RunDir/output/SLHA





Other features are available/will come soon...

Please take a look and let me know if you find some problems/have suggestions of any kind. 

Enjoy it, Martin
